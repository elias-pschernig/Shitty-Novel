# Chapter 1

Seemingly overnight, summer had ended and winter begun.  

The cold, making people either lethargically stay in bed, or panic when they got up at their normal time but didn't account for the weather, and had to quickly scrape the damned ice off their car and rush to work.

The birds, migrating in large groups, leaving parked cars covered in their crap.

The pumpkin, and peppermint, and cider, and maybe cinnamon. 

All signs of a new season that arrived and I am here, looking through my window. 
Looking as time passes by over me.

I hear the door knock. "That's strange,"-I think to myself-"I didn't order anything, who could that be?"

I waddle over to the kitchen window and try to stare out. The door doesn't have a peep-hole, so I have to look like an idiot and find another way to see who it is. I lean over the kitchen sink and try to peer out stealthily, but it's no use; they're too far away.

After a minute of silence, I open the door. I hope it's just the UPS guy, because I like getting packages. Oh, no, that wasn't a euphamism. I'm just addicted to Amazon.

Nobody is to be seen. I look left and right, but to no avail - whoever or whatever I heard before is no longer here. However, as I look to the right, I see a migrating bird crap on my car. As I run to clean off my car, I trip over a package from ebay. I don't recognize the return shipping address. What could it be?

I pick up the tissue-box-sized package and balance it together in my arms with the paper towels and Windex, and walk back inside.  The other things get dropped lazily onto the kitchen counter, and I pick up a knife to open the package with. I pull out the popcorn (damn, no bubble wrap). I jump backwards, startled. Inside the box, are a set of Pokémon cards... covered in blood.

I opened the cupboard and put on a pair of yellow latex gloves. I carefully remove the pokemon cards only to find a note underneath, written in crayon. The words are not legible, however. This appears to be the handwriting of a doctor.

I give up trying to decipher it and instead lick the card. I instantly recognize the taste. "Mhh tomato juice." There's only one doctor I know who would drink tomato juice while wrapping a package..

# Chapter 2

I tried to phone up Dr. Alecan, but he wasn't answering his phone. *Damn it, Sev Alecan* I thought to myself.

The Pokémon cards were a thoughtful gift. After all, I had been excited about the October Pokemon X/Y release. And I needed to talk to Dr. Alecan about my prescription; I was probably due for another eye exam soon.

I popped in my car, still covered in bird shit, put my GPS in the mount, and waited about an hour for it to find a satellite.

After a long drive past the countryside and through a large forest I finally arrived at the Alecan mansion. It was a ridiculous location for a doctor's office - and if I hadn't had a secret crush on him I would have changed to another eye doctor long ago.

The huge pair of doors at the entrance can be intimidating at the distance but the crest of Alecan famiy in the middle of both, a sheep holding a stick in it's mouth made me throw a giggle everytime.
Searching on the interwebs for it has been to no avail -maybe my google-fu isnt advanced enough- and I never had the courage to ask him what it means...

Amy nervously grabs the necklace she is wearing, and then after taking a deep breath she walks up to the massive double-doors and knocks the doors with the frightening wolf knocker things.

I'm still approaching the mansion as I observe Amy.  She works at the eye doctors, but seems a bit off today. I feel a slight pang of jealousy- she looks like she's also expecting more from Dr. Alecan than just filing records on patients. I push aside the wave of inadequacy that begins pooling in my mind, and continue approaching the door.

Amy has already knocked, I step up the deck and greet her nervously. 

The heavy wooden door creaks as it slowly opens. Nobody is standing inside; did the door open on its own?  Amy smiles briefly at me and walks in, obviously knowing where she's going. I think I remember my way to the front desk, maybe I can page Dr. Alecan there.

I step inside and look around. Amy already seems to have disappeared.. Did I lose track of how much time I spent outside waiting? Thinking the hallway is to the right, I decide to walk in that direction, but something seems strange.  I notice the lights in the hall aren't on. Surely these are normal business hours? I check my watch only to find that 2 hours have passed since I arrived at the mansion. I become frightened and suddenly I hear a loud SLAM.... The entrance has shut itself... I run back to the door to find no one around, and it is locked. I am now trapped alone in this huge mansion (about 35000 square feet, or 3,251.6 m²) seemingly alone. Amy is nowhere to be found. Trapped, I begin to plot what my next course of action should be.

After hesitating for a while, I decide to walk up the big stairway at the opposite end of the hall, which should lead to the doctor's apartment. Likely that's also where Amy went. But the moment I set my foot on the first step, I cringe - someone behind me just put a hand on my shoulder.

It is Amy. How did she get there without me noticing? But for the time being I'm relieved I'm not alone anymore. "What are you doing?" she asks. Wordless I pull out the pack of Pokemon cards with red stains and show it to her. She gives me an ominous look. Then she opens her purse and produces another set of Pokemon cards.


"I can't find my way around this place. How do I get to Dr. Alecan's office?" I question.

"I..." Amy pauses, "I know my way around this place. I've worked here for a while. I just... can't find my way anymore."

"Anymore?"

"It's like something is off... The rooms are different, or I'm not remembering right." Amy admits, a bit embarrassed.

"Oh, well, are you tired?" I begin to ask, but then realize I don't really care that much. "Let's just keep wandering until we can find somebody to ask." I interrupt Amy before she can respond.

Amy says, "I think we should go this way," and points to the northern corridor. Amy and I begin walking down the corridor. As we walk, I thought to myself "If Amy is a regular employee here, why haven't I seen her before?" Even though I'm clearly antisocial and uninterested in any sort of smalltalk, I ask Amy "So, how long have you worked here?" She responds by telling me that she's fairly new here and has only been working here for the past 2 months. That would make sense since my last eye exam was about a year ago.

We eventually come to a fork in the hall. "Which way should we go?", asks Amy."You are the one who works here", I reply. She doesnt want to decide so we leave it to luck. I take a coin out of my pocket and call heads. I toss the coin in the air and realize that I didn't choose a direction for heads. The coin falls to the ground and lands on...

... Its edge.  I pick up the coin again and toss it. Edge again. All at once, my brain just goes,"ALKAJWFE JHSADKJ KAFJHSAWUIEFH ALSKDJF ASFH"

Then i get distracted by a light that appears from a door at the end of the left hallway. "That must be the doctor, let's go over there"-i say- and i get no objections from Amy. We walk to the door and before i open it Amy stops me. "Wait!, dont you know you have to knock before opening a door?, you never know what anyone could be doing there". I get a bit angry at her silliness, as if the doctor could be doing anything shameful. 

I knock a few time but there's no answer so we proceed to open the door slowly. When we finally open the door we are presented with the biggest bathroom i have ever seen. The bathtub could easily fit like 10 people, everything seems from the finest marbel and looks so shiny. I'm so surprised Amy can tell from my face, when i notice how she's looking at me i get blushed and look away in shame. She must be used to this glamour by now, but then i get a glympse of myself in the mirror... "There's nothing to be ashamed, i..." - i interrupted Amy mid sentence. "Amy!"-my face changed from red to the whitest white- " these are not my glasses" and i faint.


# Chapter 3

* Remove this note once everyone's readjusted: The main character from Chapter 1 and 2 is Pat, who gets a name in this chapter. In Chapter 3, the first-person perspective is Amy's.
* There are hints - Amy messes with her necklace, and she saw Pat faint.

When I come to, I'm alone in a chair in a tiny room. There are machines for measuring eye-sight on one side of me, and directly ahead is a faint projection of letters in a box on the wall.

"Pat?" I ask. I slide off the leathery eye exam chair and poke around the office.  In the mirror, I watch myself fumble with my necklace as I try to gather my thoughts.

*I saw Pat faint. Then I must have fainted, too.*

I bite my lip as I stare at myself in the mirror, unsure. But, I'm alone now, so I feel a little more calm - less antagonized by Pat, snapping at me for no reason.

I gently open the office door and peer out.

"Sev? Dr. Alecan?"

The hallway and all of the offices are dim, it seems like the office is closed, even though it's a mid-morning, mid-week.  Right? My head feels like a pot of mashed potatoes; I feel disoriented. 

*For how long was I faint? This is all so weird, I'm going home now... Better call someone to pick me up while I walk to the entrance - if i can find it.* 

A chilling sensation moves from the bottom of my spine to the top of my head: I can't feel my cellphone in my pants. I proceed to confirm it and my cellphone is gone. 

"Did I drop it?" - I think to myself- "but wait, how did I get here? Did somebody moved me here?", 

If somebody did move me then that person could know where my cellphone was. Maybe ...taP... moved me and went looking for something. Yeah, that's probably it. I'll just wait here for Pamty.. ..Sevpat... Dr. Amycan... to come back. My brain feels foggy.

I waited for 20 minutes, and still no signs of anybody. I start to get desperate.  I feel queasy. I've managed to get down the hallway, to the receptionist desk. The office is cyan now. The world slows, then speeds up.

I puke on the office chair my workmate, Clarissa, usually sits at.

Puke... Neck tight, the ceiling. It's white again, but... Why does it smell like-- oh. Maybe, if I... I miss my dog.

Without realizing it, I'm laying on the floor.  Fuzzy carpet. Fuzzy, textured, nice carpet. Reminds me of home. I rub the carpet nubs under my fingers, and they feel fuzzy. I admire the plaid blue-ish pattern. The smell of use.

"AAammyyyy" I say to myself. "AMY. AYY. MEE. GET IT TOGETHER!"
 
I struggle to get my mind together, but it's just too... kumquat.  Maybe I should just take a nap.  I curl up in the kid's waiting room, because Flopalope the bear is here. I love Flopalope.

I don't know how long I staid like this, but after a while I start feeling thirsty. My mind also seems to have sobered up a bit. Everything is so weird - I feel like in some shitty novel. And who is this woman, Pat? What is her relationship to the doctor, and why did she have those Pokemon cards? Did the doctor send them to both of us? What for?

I push a button on the back of Flopalope's head which makes him play the soothing tune of a children's song. However it's not the same song it usually plays when I turn it on for little children waiting here. It's the same tune, but instead of making me feel happy as it would do otherwise, it sounds slightly... distorted and disconcerting.

* You can continue working on Chapter 3 if you would like, or work on Chapter 4, since they are happening SIMULTANEOUSLY! WOOOOOOO!

# Chapter 4

* Note for the confused author: Pat is the first-person character in this chapter

I'm laying on what feels like a well polished floor in my face. I can't feel the glasses in my face anymore "Shit!... What just happened? Where am i?" - i say. I try to open my eyes but it's futile. I try to move but i can't. Im starting to feel anxious and i need to calm down. "Pat, calm down!" - i repeat to myself. I start breathing in and out slowly, trying to maintain focus in this situation. After a while i start feeling cramps in my left arm, then the right arm, then my legs. It hurts like hell but i get pass by. I try to stand up but i feel so weak. I cant open my eyes yet. "ugh! why is this happening? I want to go home."- i say to myself -"DOCTOR!!! AMY!!!"- i shout but to no avail, nobody responds and i break. "Where is everybody?!" "Somebody respond!!!". 

After a while of snobing and just plain laying hopelessly on the floor i hear a sound in the distant, like a MIDI playing some song. I call for Amy and get no response so i start trying to get up. I still cant see so i try to look for a wall to support me. When i find it i get up and start walking slowly in the direction of the sound.

The sound get's louder so i increase my speed. "Amy!! can you hear me? Are you ok? Please, answer!!!". Still no response. I follow the sound to a door and so i slide my hand towars the knob stumbling a bit. I turn the knob carefully and open the door. Before i can get inside i can feel my eyes getting moisty and suddently i can open them again. The door i just open is anohter bathroom and a mirror is right in front of me. I cant believe what im seeing, it's my reflection in perfect 20/20 vision...

I hear the sound of a cricket chirping somewhere in the bathroom.. Randomly curious, I begin searching around for the cricket. I get on my hands and knees and begin crawling around the floor, only to realize the sound isn't coming from the ground, but the ceiling... I isolate its location to one of the bathroom stalls. I climb up onto the toilet and remove the ceiling tile. I find a ThinkGeek Annoy-a-Tron 2.0 up above the ceiling tile with a note attached to it... But that is not the only thing I found. When removed, the ceiling tile revealed a hidden passage through the mansion. I wonder where this passage leads. And the note? It reads "I don't know where this passage leads, but it is my hope that being a totally unobvious path to take, it will lead me OUT of this God forsaken mansion. It is my hope that if I succeed, someone will find my Annoy-a-Tron and note, and find their way out as well." It is simply signed, "Mac."

While it seems like a crazy idea, I decide to climb up and follow the secret passage. Standing on the toilet seat, I grab on to the edge of the square opening in the ceiling and try to pull myself up. And then realize that getting into that opening - will be hard. There is nothing to hold on inside, but carefully stepping onto the toilet tank and a cabinet on the wall I manage to climb in. And hit my head hard. I'm in some narrow quadratic tube, slowly crawling forward. There's not enough space to turn around. After a while there is a junction, with paths leading to the left and right. I decide to continue on straight ahead. I encounter several more junctions - then suddenly the tube starts sloping downwards. When it gets so steep that I have a hard time holding on I decide it's safer to crawl backwards and try one of the junctions - but that moment I slip and start sliding down. I desperately try to hold on to the walls, but it's too late - I slide down a winding path, then finally fall through an opening. I'm in what appears to be a small basement room. I can't see a ceiling but a diffuse light from above dimly lits the room. Leaning against the opposite wall there's a skeleton sitting. "Must be Mac." I think.

# Chapter 5

I make a brief mental note to *always* pick up blueprints of a place before I head there, any time in the future. I know it's a silly thought, but now I was wishing that I had a map of those vents.

Tears well in my eyes at the sight of the skeleton. I hope that Dr. Alecan isn't a secret murderer- it is no good to have secret fuzzy feelings for a murderer.  My chest is tight and I can barely breathe - both from stress, panic, and well as the mold.

I study the basement walls - this whole room is maybe the size of a walk-in closet. Besides Mac, there are some old, yellowed books in stacks, a keg with a skull and crossbones painted on it, and an old, super-heterodyne radio.  There were no apparent doors.
