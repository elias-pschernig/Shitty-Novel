# Chapter 1

Seemingly overnight, summer had ended and winter begun.  

The cold, making people either lethargically stay in bed, or panic when they got up at their normal time but didn't account for the weather, and had to quickly scrape the damned ice off their car and rush to work.

The birds, migrating in large groups, leaving parked cars covered in their crap.

The pumpkin, and peppermint, and cider, and maybe cinnamon. 

All signs of a new season that arrived and I am here, looking through my window. 
Looking as time passes by over me.

I hear the door knock. "That's strange,"-I think to myself-"I didn't order anything, who could that be?"

I waddle over to the kitchen window and try to stare out. The door doesn't have a peep-hole, so I have to look like an idiot and find another way to see who it is. I lean over the kitchen sink and try to peer out stealthily, but it's no use; they're too far away.

After a minute of silence, I open the door. I hope it's just the UPS guy, because I like getting packages. Oh, no, that wasn't a euphamism. I'm just addicted to Amazon.

Nobody is to be seen. I look left and right, but to no avail - whoever or whatever I heard before is no longer here. However, as I look to the right, I see a migrating bird crap on my car. As I run to clean off my car, I trip over a package from ebay. I don't recognize the return shipping address. What could it be?

I pick up the tissue-box-sized package and balance it together in my arms with the paper towels and Windex, and walk back inside.  The other things get dropped lazily onto the kitchen counter, and I pick up a knife to open the package with. I pull out the popcorn (damn, no bubble wrap). I jump backwards, startled. Inside the box, are a set of Pok√©mon cards... covered in blood.

I opened the cupboard and put on a pair of yellow latex gloves. I carefully remove the pokemon cards only to find a note underneath, written in crayon. The words are not legible, however. This appears to be the handwriting of a doctor.
