# Chapter 1

Seemingly overnight, summer had ended and winter begun.  

The cold, making people either lethargically stay in bed, or panic when they got up at their normal time but didn't account for the weather, and had to quickly scrape the damned ice off their car and rush to work.

The birds, migrating in large groups, leaving parked cars covered in their crap.

The pumpkin, and peppermint, and cider, and maybe cinnamon. 

All signs of a new season that arrived and I am here, looking through my window. 
Looking as time passes by over me.

I hear the door knock. "That's strange,"-I think to myself-"I didn't order anything, who could that be?"

I waddle over to the kitchen window and try to stare out. The door doesn't have a peep-hole, so I have to look like an idiot and find another way to see who it is. I lean over the kitchen sink and try to peer out stealthily, but it's no use; they're too far away.

After a minute of silence, I open the door. I hope it's just the UPS guy, because I like getting packages. Oh, no, that wasn't a euphamism. I'm just addicted to Amazon.

Nobody is to be seen. I look left and right, but to no avail - whoever or whatever I heard before is no longer here. However, as I look to the right, I see a migrating bird crap on my car. As I run to clean off my car, I trip over a package from ebay. I don't recognize the return shipping address. What could it be?

I pick up the tissue-box-sized package and balance it together in my arms with the paper towels and Windex, and walk back inside.  The other things get dropped lazily onto the kitchen counter, and I pick up a knife to open the package with. I pull out the popcorn (damn, no bubble wrap). I jump backwards, startled. Inside the box, are a set of Pokémon cards... covered in blood.

I opened the cupboard and put on a pair of yellow latex gloves. I carefully remove the pokemon cards only to find a note underneath, written in crayon. The words are not legible, however. This appears to be the handwriting of a doctor.

I give up trying to decipher it and instead lick the card. I instantly recognize the taste. "Mhh tomato juice." There's only one doctor I know who would drink tomato juice while wrapping a package..

# Chapter 2

I tried to phone up Dr. Alecan, but he wasn't answering his phone. *Damn it, Sev Alecan* I thought to myself.

The Pokémon cards were a thoughtful gift. After all, I had been excited about the October Pokemon X/Y release. And I needed to talk to Dr. Alecan about my prescription; I was probably due for another eye exam soon.

I popped in my car, still covered in bird shit, put my GPS in the mount, and waited about an hour for it to find a satellite.

After a long drive past the countryside and through a large forest I finally arrived at the Alecan mansion. It was a ridiculous location for a doctor's office - and if I hadn't had a secret crush on him I would have changed to another eye doctor long ago.

The huge pair of doors at the entrance can be intimidating at the distance but the crest of Alecan famiy in the middle of both, a sheep holding a stick in it's mouth made me throw a giggle everytime.
Searching on the interwebs for it has been to no avail -maybe my google-fu isnt advanced enough- and I never had the courage to ask him what it means...

Amy nervously grabs the necklace she is wearing, and then after taking a deep breath she walks up to the massive double-doors and knocks the doors with the frightening wolf knocker things.

I'm still approaching the mansion as I observe Amy.  She works at the eye doctors, but seems a bit off today. I feel a slight pang of jealousy- she looks like she's also expecting more from Dr. Alecan than just filing records on patients. I push aside the wave of inadequacy that begins pooling in my mind, and continue approaching the door.

Amy has already knocked, I step up the deck and greet her nervously. 

The heavy wooden door creaks as it slowly opens. Nobody is standing inside; did the door open on its own?  Amy smiles briefly at me and walks in, obviously knowing where she's going. I think I remember my way to the front desk, maybe I can page Dr. Alecan there.

I step inside and look around. Amy already seems to have disappeared.. Did I lose track of how much time I spent outside waiting? Thinking the hallway is to the right, I decide to walk in that direction, but something seems strange.  I notice the lights in the hall aren't on. Surely these are normal business hours? I check my watch only to find that 2 hours have passed since I arrived at the mansion. I become frightened and suddenly I hear a loud SLAM.... The entrance has shut itself... I run back to the door to find no one around, and it is locked. I am now trapped alone in this huge mansion (about 35000 square feet, or 3,251.6 m²) seemingly alone. Amy is nowhere to be found. Trapped, I begin to plot what my next course of action should be.

After hesitating for a while, I decide to walk up the big stairway at the opposite end of the hall, which should lead to the doctor's apartment. Likely that's also where Amy went. But the moment I set my foot on the first step, I cringe - someone behind me just put a hand on my shoulder.

It is Amy. How did she get there without me noticing? But for the time being I'm relieved I'm not alone anymore. "What are you doing?" she asks. Wordless I pull out the pack of Pokemon cards with red stains and show it to her. She gives me an ominous look. Then she opens her purse and produces another set of Pokemon cards.


"I can't find my way around this place. How do I get to Dr. Alecan's office?" I question.

"I..." Amy pauses, "I know my way around this place. I've worked here for a while. I just... can't find my way anymore."

"Anymore?"

"It's like something is off... The rooms are different, or I'm not remembering right." Amy admits, a bit embarrassed.

"Oh, well, are you tired?" I begin to ask, but then realize I don't really care that much. "Let's just keep wandering until we can find somebody to ask." I interrupt Amy before she can respond.

Amy says, "I think we should go this way," and points to the northern corridor. Amy and I begin walking down the corridor. As we walk, I thought to myself "If Amy is a regular employee here, why haven't I seen her before?" Even though I'm clearly antisocial and uninterested in any sort of smalltalk, I ask Amy "So, how long have you worked here?" She responds by telling me that she's fairly new here and has only been working here for the past 2 months. That would make sense since my last eye exam was about a year ago.

We eventually come to a fork in the hall. "Which way should we go?", asks Amy."You are the one who works here", I reply. She doesnt want to decide so we leave it to luck. I take a coin out of my pocket and call heads. I toss the coin in the air and realize that I didn't choose a direction for heads. The coin falls to the ground and lands on...

... Its edge.  I pick up the coin again and toss it. Edge again. All at once, my brain just goes,

"ALKAJWFE JHSADKJ KAFJHSAWUIEFH ALSKDJF ASFH"

And rather than reacting rationally by choosing a direction, or investigating the coin further, or attempting to detect magnets, my brain just gives up. I pass out.

# Chapter 3

When I come to, I'm alone in a chair in a tiny room. There are machines for measuring eye-sight on one side of me, and directly ahead is a faint projection of letters in a box on the wall.
