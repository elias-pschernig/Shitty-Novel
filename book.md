Seemingly overnight, summer had ended and winter begun.  

The cold, making people either lethargically stay in bed, or panic when they got up at their normal time but didn't account for the weather, and had to quickly scrape the damned ice off their car and rush to work.

The birds, migrating in large groups, leaving parked cars covered in their crap.

The pumpkin, and peppermint, and cider, and maybe cinnamon. 

All signs of a new season that arrived and I am here, looking through my window. 
Looking as time passes by over me.

I hear the door knock. "That's strange,"-I think to myself-"I didn't order anything, who could that be?"

I waddle over to the kitchen window and try to stare out. The door doesn't have a peep-hole, so I have to look like an idiot and find another way to see who it is. I lean over the kitchen sink and try to peer out stealthily, but it's no use; they're too far away.

After a minute of silence, I open the door. I hope it's just the UPS guy, because I like getting packages. Oh, no, that wasn't a euphamism. I'm just addicted to Amazon.
