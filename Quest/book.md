# Chapter 1

Some quests are for finding treasure. Some quests are for saving another from evil. Some quests are for fighting and glory. But, when Queen Kuko sent for her bravest knights, she had her eye on something different. Her thirst for blood was no secret to anyone. 

When she was a princess she used to practice with the sword and handguns everyday and more than once asked her father to let her fight. "No! We are rulers, no fighters. If something happened to a royal family member the warriors would be devastated, what reasons would they fight for?"-said her father more than once. "They dont fight for us. They fight for themselves. They defend each other. They love each other... And if for some reason they fought for us. Wouldn't it vengance and honor be an even bigger motivation to fight for than the person who's always telling them what to do and sending the to die?"-she once replied and her father didnt answer back.

Tired of doing nothing she once sneaked into battle, the frontlines nonetheless. She left instructions to her nana in a note on what to do while she was gone in order to avoid the king's wrath, but didnt tell where she was to, her nana wouldnt allow it. 

To hide her identity she stole a platoon's officer uniform and because she had the most fire-ish red hair anyone had ever seen she dyed it black.  The kingdom's army had both men and women so it was no problem to pass by, the trick was in not talking to much since she could call undersired attention and be discovered. 

The army was divided by platoons, each platoon consisted of 8 people. A medic, a communications person, two snipers, one explosives and three infantry, two of wich served as the sniper's watchers. Generally the leader of the team was one of the snipers or the remaining infantry person. Either way the orders were always very clear and each member of the team had no choise but to make them happen no matter what. 

The assignation was made random for each mission, to assure cohesino between everybody. "Since they dont know who they would end up going out next with, they better get along with everyone"- was the logic behind it. 

Her platoon number was 17. Nobody but the platoon knows much of what follows but by the third day of the fight the leader was shoot and since in the fear and confusion of war, warriors follow the orders of anyone who sounds confidence enough so since confidence was something she had in spare she took the job of leading the platoon until victory was seized. but by the time people knew she was the king's daughter there the battle was over and she personally chopped the head off from any survivor. 

That little incident made her father decide to pass her the title of ruler of the kingdom when he died. Even her older brother agreed. Most of the members of her platoon became part of her guard except for one who was injured. So much is her strength...
