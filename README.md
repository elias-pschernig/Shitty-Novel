Shitty-Novel
============

This is going to be a very disjoined and uncoordinated novel.

Add onto *book.md* with your bit of story, building up on what was there previously.

Don't worry about your ideas being good or unique, just write for the sake of writing!



You can also start your own <bookname>.md file and write the beginning of contents
for your story, which other contributors will then expand upon.

**No, I'm not waiting for November. Feel free to write whenever**

## Special Characters
If you need to type "Ã©" on Windows, hold left-Alt and type (on the number pad), 0233

The apparent plot hole gave me an idea for a plot twist, please don't correct :T
