Seemingly overnight, summer had ended and winter begun.  

The cold, making people either lethargicly stay in bed, or panic when they got up at their normal time but didn't account for the weather, and had to quickly scrape the damned ice off their car and rush to work.

The birds, migrating in large groups, leaving parked cars covered in their crap.

The pumpkin, and peppermint, and cider, and maybe cinnamon.
